## Task

It is the year 2100 and you run an interplanetary space travel agency.  You are building a website to book scientists on missions to other planets.  You already have built out your planetary database to perform all CRUD actions on the planets you travel to.  It is your job to build out Scientist and Mission models so that scientists can book their missions.  In a given mission, one scientist will visit one planet.  Over their careers, scientists will book many missions to many planets; planets will be visited by many scientists.

## Instructions

- Sketch out the domain of the models of Planet, Scientist and Mission.  Think about what foreign keys should go on which models.  What are the relationships between the three?

- Once you are confident in your domain sketch (ask for a thumbs up from an instructor!) build out the models and migrations for your database.  
    - Your Scientist model should have a name (string) and field_of_study (string).  
    - Your Mission model should have a name (string).  
    - You will also need to include foreign keys on the appropiate models.
